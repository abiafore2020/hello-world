# hello-world
This is for HW 0 COP 4655! Hi Dr J and/or TA's :)

My name's Angelina Biafore, I'm a senior at FAU majoring in Computer Science! I plan on getting
a minor in Cybersecurity and am hoping to get one in Artificial Intelligence, but I would have to
take 6 classes my Spring Semester of senior year, and I might not want to work myself that hard!
At the very least I'll get a certificate! I'm originally from Rhode Island, and love getting outside
and skiing! Interesting choice coming to Florida, but I really wanted to get away from New England
for a bit. I'm not in a lot of on campus clubs besides my sorority Sigma Kappa, which is really cool
because I'm the only computer science major in our chapter :)
